## Summary of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme employs a structured project management approach centered on iterative delivery and customer-first principles, guiding projects through five high-level lifecycle stages: initiation, planning, execution, release, and close with retrospective. Key workflows include project initiation with problem statements and stakeholder alignment, followed by detailed planning involving scope definition, resource allocation, and milestone setting. Execution focuses on agile practices such as daily standups, weekly syncs, and pull request (PR) workflows emphasizing small, reviewable changes with automated testing and CI checks. Release and deployment incorporate verification steps, while retrospectives drive continuous improvement by capturing learnings and action items to refine future processes.

Core personas at OctoAcme include Project Managers (PMs) who coordinate schedules, risks, and communications to ensure timely delivery; Product Managers (PdMs) who define outcomes, prioritize backlogs, and validate success through metrics; and Developers who implement features, write tests, and participate in code reviews. Additional roles encompass QA/Testers for validation and Stakeholders for input and approvals, fostering clear ownership and collaboration across cross-functional teams.

Communication strategies emphasize transparency and regular cadence, with weekly syncs between PMs and PdMs, twice-weekly standups for delivery teams, and monthly stakeholder updates. A risk register is maintained to identify, assess, and mitigate issues, monitored via weekly reviews and escalations following defined paths from team-level to sponsor-level as needed. For incident communication, templates cover triage, actions, timelines, and post-incident retrospectives, ensuring alignment and psychological safety.

Quality assurance practices integrate testing at multiple levels, including unit and integration tests for code reliability, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, and manual QA for feature acceptance. Security scanning is embedded in CI pipelines, with a focus on high test coverage, observability, and definition of done criteria. Reporting tracks velocity, burndown, and success metrics via dashboards, while blockers are escalated through tiered levels to maintain project integrity and data-informed decision-making.
